I was able to load Structure Porter on both worlds and save/export a .mcstructure file, but I couldn't get it to load/import into the realms world.

After much googles I found youtube watch?v=tvWmJdXBsN4 which shows you how to turn the .mcstructure into a behavior pack using https://www.8crafter.com/utilities/mcstructure-loader.html

I was then able to load the behavior pack onto my realms world and then able to load the imported structure into a structure block.
